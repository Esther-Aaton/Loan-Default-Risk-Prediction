# Loan-Default-Risk-Prediction
I developed a machine learning model to predict loan default risk using three datasets. Several classification algorithms; including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost, were trained and evaluated using multiple performance metrics. The final model was selected based on its overall predictive accuracy and robustness.
